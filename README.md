# Instructions:

1. [Download the latest stable release here (v1.1)](https://github.com/crocokyle/Valorant-Ultrawide-Fix/releases)

2. **Extract the entire zip to its own folder.** Do not just run the setup from within the zip file. 

3. Open the new folder that you extracted to and run `install.bat`
    - This script will run quickly and clean itself up. 
    
4. Launch the game in ultrawide by running the pink desktop shortcut labeled `Valorant Ultrawide Launcher`

5. To uninstall Valorant-Ultrawide-Fix, `uninstall.bat` should have been generated into your extracted folder. Run this to remove all changes.
<hr />
Disclaimer: This script runs Valorant in windowed mode. It should still appear exactly as if it is fullscreen. Running in windowed mode does decrease your performance slightly because it is rendering your desktop simultaneously. Rendering a larger resolution also reduces performance so you may notice a lower frame rate.

# Troubleshooting

1. Make sure the zip was extracted to its own folder before running `install.bat`

2. Check your log files. Open the folder created by the script in `Documents\ValorantUltrawideHack`
    - `install_log.log`
    - `SysSetup_log.log`
    - `ValorantLauncher_log.log`
